# Auto Shades app for Hubitat
An app for Hubitat that can automatically control smartblinds and shades, by integrating with a light sensor.

Auto Shades will automatically close your smartblinds if the light sensor gets over a threshold value.  It will re-open them when it's no longer so bright.

It also has configurable timeouts, so it won't override any manual changes you make to the shades.

## Installation

The best way to install this code is by using [Hubitat Package Manager](https://community.hubitat.com/t/beta-hubitat-package-manager).

But if you install manually, there are two Hubitat apps to install on your hub.  (A parent and a child instance app.)  You need them both.
