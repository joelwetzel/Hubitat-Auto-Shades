# Hubitat-Auto-Shades
An app for Hubitat that can automatically control smartblinds and shades, by integrating with a light sensor.

Auto Shades will automatically close your smartblinds if the light sensor gets over a threshold value.  It will re-open them when it's no longer so bright.

It also has configurable timeouts, so it won't override any manual changes you make to the shades.
